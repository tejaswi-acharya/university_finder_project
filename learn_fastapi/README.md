# learn_fastapi

This folder contains files that were created **purely while learning FastAPI as a beginner**.

All code inside this directory is **experimental and educational**.  
It is **not production-ready** and is **not intended to follow professional project structure or best practices**.

## Important note (no linkage)

**This folder has NO linkage with the main University Finder application.**

- The files here are **completely independent**
- They are **not imported, used, or referenced** anywhere in the main project
- Changes made in this folder **do not affect** the University Finder app in any way

This folder exists **only for learning purposes** and is **separate from the actual project codebase**.

## Why this folder exists

Before starting the University Finder backend, I used this space to:
- Learn FastAPI fundamentals from scratch
- Experiment freely with routes and request methods
- Practice query parameters, path parameters, and HTTP methods
- Make mistakes and learn without worrying about structure

Because of this, the code here **may not look professional**, and that is intentional.

## Current status

- Files were written during my early learning phase
- Code style, naming, and organization may be inconsistent
- This folder acts as a **personal sandbox / learning log**

## Future plans

If I continue learning FastAPI further:
- This folder may be updated with new learning examples
- Additional experimental files may be added
- Older files may remain unchanged to show learning progress

## Where the real project lives

The **actual backend for the University Finder application** is located in the main project directory (outside this folder).

This `learn_fastapi` directory is **strictly educational** and **not part of the application logic**.

 *This folder documents my learning journey and has no functional role in the University Finder project.*
